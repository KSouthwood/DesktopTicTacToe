# [Desktop Tic-Tac-Toe](https://hyperskill.org/projects/174)

## About
Everyone is familiar with Tic-tac-toe. Create a version of this game using the Swing graphics library. Teach a 
computer to play this game and compete against both your friend and AI.

## Learning Outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a program from scratch, using 
methods, handling errors, and processing user input.

### Stage 1: [Setup](https://hyperskill.org/projects/174/stages/897/implement)
#### _Create the main program window and the playing field._
Tic-tac-toe is played all over the world. There are a lot of versions of the 
game with different rules, but the essence of the game remains. Anyway, it's
always good to refresh our memory about the rules.

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game with a 3x3 grid. One of the players is `X`,
another player is `O`. `X` starts first, then `O` takes the next turn, and so
on. The players mark `X` or `O` on a 3x3 field. The first player that puts three
`X's` or `O's` on a straight line (including diagonals) wins the game.

In this project, you will create a Tic-tac-toe game with a graphical user
interface (GUI) using the Swing framework. The program will allow you to play
both against another player or a computer. You can also configure the game so
that the computer can play against itself.

### Stage 2: [The game is on!](https://hyperskill.org/projects/174/stages/898/implement)
#### _Add a status bar and a Reset button and play your friend._
In this stage, we will add an event listener for our field cells. When you click on a free cell for the first time, 
add an `X` symbol to the cell. The second click on another free cell should add an `O` symbol. You will also need a 
status bar and a `Reset`button. A click on the `Reset` button should clear the field. These improvements can allow 
you to play Tic-tac-toe against your friend.

### Stage 3: [Rise of the machines](https://hyperskill.org/projects/174/stages/899/implement)
#### _Teach the computer how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. Add a control panel to choose the sides before a game starts._
In this stage, you will teach a computer how to play Tic-tac-toe. Add a control panel to choose the sides. You will 
also need a start button to start the game.

### Stage 4: [Can I have the Menu?](https://hyperskill.org/projects/174/stages/900/implement)
#### _Add a menu that allows you to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement._
This is the final stage of our project. You need to add a menu for a quick game launch with a specific player 
configuration. Your program also lacks more detailed messages in the status bar about the current status of the game.
